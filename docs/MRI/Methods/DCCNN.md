# A Deep Cascade of Convolutional Neural Networks for MR Image Reconstruction

## Introduction

Undersampling in *k*-space violates the Nyquist-Shannon theorem and generates aliasing artefacts when the image is reconstructed. The main challenge in this case is to find an algorithm that taks into account the undersampling undergone and can compensate missing data with a-prior knowledge on the image to be reconstructed.
