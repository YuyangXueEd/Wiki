## Introduction

Two evaluation measures, calibration and domain shift, are applied, which are usually inspired by the practical applications of NNs:
- Calibration measures the discrepancy between long-run frequencies and subjective forecasts
- domain shift concerns the generalisation of predictive uncertainty to a domain shift that estimates whether the network knows that it knows.

An ensemble of models enhances the predictive performance. However, it is not evident why and when an ensemble of NNs can generate good uncertainty estimates. 

Bayesian model averaging (BMA) believes that the true model lies within the hypothesis class of the prior and executes soft model selection to locate the single best model within the hypothesis class. In contrast, ensembles combine models to discover more powerful models; ensembles can be anticipated to be better when the true model does not lie within the hypothesis class.
