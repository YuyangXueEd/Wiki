### Major Hyperparameters and Search Space

Two groups of hyperparameters:

1. Used for training 
	1. The proper choice of them allows NN to learn faster and achieve enhanced performance.
2. Used for model design
	1. The structure of NN, measure the models learning capacity, determined by the complexity of function

#### Learning Rate

LR is a positive scalar that determines the length of step during SGD.

- A fixed LR 
- A varied LR over
